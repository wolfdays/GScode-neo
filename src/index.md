Hello, fellow traveler. Be welcome to _The Glowship_.
This is, as most say, my little personal corner in the web. I am the Pilot of the machine. I am a rather introverted individual, but also find great joy in sharing my babbling and trinkets with the world. So, I decided to open the Glowship to the public, in search of said joy. And this is the product of that thought :). You are aboard.

As of right now, the Glowship is found mostly devoid of... _anything_. It is, however, an ongoing work in progress. In fact, right now as you're reading this, I'm probably hammering away in my corner of the ship, progressing that work.

As for me, I'm just a common 19 year-old with a passion for art and design. Coding is quite a new thing for me, but I'm enjoying it this far! The fact that this website continues to exist is proof of that.

This text right here is mostly just placeholder tattle, as I test things and mess around with the web structure... It might as well just stay here forever, though. That's for future webmaster Pilot to decide. Definitely not me.

My current major interests are.. a few. We should probably start with Team Fortress 2. I was introduced to it by my partner around 1 month ago, and I might've gotten a bit too much into it since that. I'm currently allowing myself to indulge in my personal headcanons surrounding it, as well as reading some fanfiction. I'll possibly write about that here!

Secondly, there's sewing and fashion design, as those are the studies I'm currently professionally undergoing. It's been an interesting journey and I believe this newfound interest will follow me for the rest of my life, and crawl it's way into my very skin. So there's that! :)

I have other hobbies, too. I like drawing the most, but I also do some writing, worldbuidling, character creation and other things of the like. If you asked me, I'd say I lie somewhere in the noun "creative", but I also can't quite tell you exactly where. I like creating things, and that is about it.

Such as this website, which is currently sucking most of my energy. Haha...
